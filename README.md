## 18F Guide to using lean UX methodology

*An interactive guide (and template) on how to plan and structure projects that use experiments to drive toward outcomes, using agile and scrum methodologies.*

###What is lean UX?

Lean UX is a collaborative, outcome-focused product development and project management philosophy and process. It builds on agile and lean principles and provides a structured way to build software through quick, iterative experiments — all within a scrum and agile sprint framework. *Note: Lean UX can be adapted to other management and development frameworks, such as Kanban, but for this guide we will focus on scrum and agile.*
 
Doing lean UX means fundamentally changing your team’s focus from outputs (for example, features, functionality, colors) to outcomes (the changes in user behavior you want to see). 

### Thanks

Our guide is primarily based on our experience practicing lean UX with teams at 18F, but also draws from ideas and materials from Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden's book: *Lean UX.*
