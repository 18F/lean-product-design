title: 1. Conduct discovery research
---
The first stage of any project is to do research to discover problems that need solving.

These design methods can help guide your research with both stakeholders and possible end users:

>- [Contextual inquiry](https://methods.18f.gov/contextual-inquiry/)[](https://methods.18f.gov/bodystorming/) 
- [Stakeholder and user interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/) 
- [Journey mapping](https://methods.18f.gov/journey-mapping/) 
- [Cognitive walkthroughs](https://methods.18f.gov/cognitive-walkthrough/) 
- [KJ method](https://methods.18f.gov/kj-method/) 
- [Heuristic analysis ](https://methods.18f.gov/heuristic-analysis/) 

Your goal is to identify the challenges both groups face and the relationship between the two groups. Focus on the problems stakeholders have, not on potential solutions.

**Lean product design may change how you do UX research.** Some UX practitioners are used to writing big reports at the conclusion of a single research phase. Here, iteration and learning over repeated experiments is valued over breadth of research. Document the results of your hypothesis test clearly and concisely so you can share them quickly with your team, learn from them, and devise another experiment.
