title: Gather your research & create your problem statement
---

**Gather your knowledge/data/research about the problem space, and
    create a problem statement as follows:**

 >We have observed that **[product/service/organization]** isn’t meeting
 **[these goals/needs]**, which is causing **[this adverse affect]**. How might we improve so that our
 product/service/team/organization is more successful based on **[these measurable
 criteria]**?

*Tip: If your team is having trouble narrowing down to a reasonable
sized problem statement, try brainstorming out goals/needs & success
criteria first as follows, then coalescing as a group around the most
relevant/important ones:*

isn’t meeting **[these goals/needs]**:

> - 

is more successful based on **[these measurable criteria]:**

> -   

**You may end up with more than one problem statement**
